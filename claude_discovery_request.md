# Discovery request

Analyze the files in the directory @old_dashboard_content and write a claude.md file, name it 'claudes_proposal.md' to reflect the features and data you discover in the directory for a new edition of the Great Lakes Dashboard. The sub-directories contain the following:

- cron: data processing python and shell scripts that were meant to be run on a server under a crontab schedule. I would hope we could port these processes to GitHub Actions for the new, progressive web version of this dashboard

- GLD_HTML5: a feature limited, JavaScript and HTML5 version of the Great Lakes Dashboard

- GLHCD_Charm: a feature rich, Adobe or Apache ActionScript version of the Great Lakes Dashboard

Also have a look at GLWLDv1_1.png for *some* top of mind features. Remember this is an old app so suggestions that are improvements from the editions in @old_dashboard_content along with the supporting scripts are very welcome
