# Make this dashboard somewhat like the old one

I would like to make this dashboard more like the original now (see ~/old_dashboard_content/GLWLDv1_1.png). 

## Desktop, laptop, or tablet screen

The title of the app, "Great Lakes Water Level Dashboard", should be centered across the top for a laptop, desktop, or tablet screen.

For a desktop, laptop, or tablet screen, plots for every lake should be visible with no scrolling, and IF POSSIBLE - no pressure, not required - create a 'plot' that's only for the horizontal axis timespan display, and hide the horizontal axis for the data plots above it. Beneath that and all of the plots, put the time range slider. For a desktop, laptop, or tablet screen, there should be two vertical axis labels outside of the plot windows: a primary one for all the plots that says "Surface water elevation ([meters, feet]: IGLD-85)" and a secondary set of vertical axis labels indicating which lake the plot pertains to. We do not need the vertical axis zoom and pan sliders. Instead, ensure the vertical scale of all plots is the same. That does not mean that the vertical min and max are the same. For the vertical scale to be the same across all plots, max minus min should be equal across all plots. So the maxes and mins can be different to capture the unique water levels of each lake, just make sure their differences are the same across lakes.

For a desktop, laptop, or tablet screen, instead of having the Legend and Menu on the right side and fixed visible, it should be a drawer or a slide-in-and-out panel from the left side. Allow each data series to be selectable in that menu, along with its stroke or fill color as appropriate, plus a background color selector (add a default color reset button as well). Make this legend and menu a modern accordion menu, with categories 1.) data series, 2.) selected lakes, 3.) Units, 4.) Selected time span, with start and end "year-month" drop down selectors, 5.) Vertical scale - for each plot, how many units should the max minus min, or range, equal? 6.) miscellaneous, with a fullscreen toggle, screenshot trigger, and about section - with links to relevant supporting organizations and data sources.

Get rid of the footer that currently exists.

## Mobile smart phone screen

For a mobile phone screen, maintain the plots with their top titles, their own horizontal axes (no plot with only the horizontal axis), bottom legends, and vertical "[m, ft] IGLD-85" labels. No two-tier vertical labels. Also on mobile, keep the time range slider on top, and app title where it's at. Vertical scale rules for desktop apply here too. The Legend and Menu as described above should still slide-in-and-out from the left, defaulting to tucked away. Also remove the footer here.

This should give you enough to start re-arranging things.
